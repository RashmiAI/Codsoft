🛠️ How It Works
User selects password length by tapping a button.

User toggles checkboxes to decide which character sets to include.

User taps "Generate Password" – the app:

Checks if at least one character type is selected.

Builds a pool of characters.

Randomly generates a password of the selected length.

User can then copy the generated password using the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
